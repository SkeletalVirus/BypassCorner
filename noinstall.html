									</h2><p>
										We have added a In-Browser Emulator! This is in very early access and there will be many bugs. This emulator <em>should</em> be compatible with all currently avaliable ROMs. Make sure to extract the .ZIP files before using them in the emulator.
									</p>
									<h2>
										12/11/2023 9:30PM EST
									</h2><p>
										Upon further inspection, Citra does not support 3DS ROMs. All download links have been temporarily removed, and will be replaced with our own files. In the meantime, we are adding BlueStacks and Emulator Box to our library so you can enjoy the Generation 4 and 5 Pokemon games. We're sorry for the inconvenience.
									</p>
									<h2>
										12/10/2023 3:30PM EST
									</h2><p>
										3DS ROMs did not include<br>downloads upon release. This is due to their large file size,<br> causing them to take a long time to download and upload. All ROMs will become avaliable to download later today!
									</p>
									<h2>
										12/09/2023 7:00PM EST
									</h2><p>
										Added Citra 3DS Emulator!<br> Along with this, we added the following ROMs to use with it:
